1.1 About the Script
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
FileMan is a powerful website management utility. It allows you to easily
manage files in your website from the comfort of your browser. It also provides
easy to use front ends for tasks such as creating tar files, extracting tar
files, running system commands, search and replace over files, and much more!

1.2 System Requirements
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
FileMan is 100% Perl and will run on a wide variety of platforms including
Linux, Windows 98/NT/2000, BSD, Solaris and much more. System requirements are:

1. A current version of Perl 5 (version 5.004_04 or better required).
2. Optional: Compress::Zlib module from CPAN. If you install this, you will be
   able to create and extract from gziped (.gz) files.
3. Optional: Archive::Zip module. This will be used to create and extract zip
   files.

2. Installation
=========================================================================
FileMan installation is very straight forward.

To install, please follow the following steps:

1. Unarchive the fileman-3.x.x.tar.gz file. If you are using Windows, you can
   use an file archiver program such as WinZip or PowerArchiver to unarchive
   .tar.gz files.

2. FTP in ASCII mode the install.cgi script to your cgi-bin directory
   on your webserver. Set the permissions of this file to 755 (rwxr-xr-x)
   if on a unix system.

3. FTP in BINARY mode the install.dat file to the same directory on your
   webserver.

4. You can now either install from your browser, or from shell. If you
   choose from the browser, all your program files will be owned by the
   web server and you will need to use FileMan to remove it.

4a. If you are installing from the web, simply go to:

       http://yoursite.com/cgi-bin/install.cgi

   and follow the prompts which will guide you the rest of the way.

4b. If you are installing from telnet/shell, simply go to the directory
   where you placed the file and then run the install.cgi. You can do this
   by just typing:

       ./install.cgi

           or

       perl install.cgi

5. Once the script has been successfully unarchived, you should now
   just go to the URL mentioned and you will be ready to go!
